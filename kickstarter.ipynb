To further clarify, if a backer has $500 to support any campaign and has a choice between a $100K or a $10K campaign goal the backer knows that its $500 will make a larger impact on the lower end goal. In percentages, it’s a choice between a 5% or 0.5% impact. Please see below for a visualization summary"

    "Firstly, based on the Kickstarter data it is recommended to pursue a campaign in the top backed sub/categories due to the advantageous position that they hold. For instance, the Tabletop subcategory is one of the most popular amongst backers on Kickstarter. Moreover, an optimal goal price would be towards the lower end matching the findings done above, where a lower campaign goal is likely more successful. About 47% of successful Tabletop campaigns have a goal price of \\$20K or less, setting a higher goal such as \\$30K only increases the number of successes by around 3% then barely increases as the goal goes higher and higher. This suggests that the analysis done on the \"Trend in Money Raising\" is valid, and a higher campaign goal yields a minimal benefit. Thus, it is highly advised to set a campaign goal of \\$20K. "
